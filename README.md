Tutump is a dating application that connects the Microsoft Band with Android and uses de SVM library from Weka to identify the current emotion form the user reading the HR(heart rate), RR(heart rate variability), and GSR(galvanic skin response). A model was trained wit 9 people. However it does not work well, and most of the time stays in one emotion.

The machine learning model is used while looking profiles, and when chating to "send the emotions".
